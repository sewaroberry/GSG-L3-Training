# GSG L3 Problem Solving Training  
This repository contains my solutions to problem-solving statements from the **GSG Level 3 Problem Solving Training**.  
All solutions are implemented in **C++** with a focus on clean code, efficiency, and clear explanations.

- Each **contest** has its own folder.  
- Inside each contest folder, every **problem** has its own folder.  
- Each problem folder contains:  
  - `solution.cpp` → The C++ solution.  
  - `README.md` → The problem statement and explanation.


  
## Goals
- Practice solving algorithmic problems.  
- Improve skills in recursion, backtracking, and other problem-solving techniques.  
- Maintain clean and well-documented solutions.
